A clustering solution for Apache CouchDB using node.js
=====================

lode is beta software and may or may not be under active development ;)

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * node.js (>=0.1.95) (http://nodejs.org/)
 * Apache CouchDB (>= 0.11) (http://couchdb.apache.org/)

Installing
^^^^^^^^^^
Unclear...
More options *might* be found by reading the `INSTALL` file.

Security Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should be aware of the security considerations involved with running Apache
CouchDB and consult the README file provided with its distribution. lode will
likely do nothing to protect you in the case of an insecurely configured or
deployed Apache CouchDB system.

Running Manually
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can start the server by running

    lode

Be sure that the node binary is in your path.

When lode starts it should eventually display the following message:

    relax party

To check that everything has worked, point your browser to:

   http://127.0.0.1:6984/

Eventually there should be a test suite, but right now there isn't.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ensure that Apache CouchDB is running successfully and consult the wiki:

Running as a Daemon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Advice welcome.
